The main contribution being my work on the Lighthouse, which as two side that can be independently changed to one of the 3 colors, red, blue and purple. Each colors as different mechanics, with blue allowing some clues to be shown and interacted with. Red showing the monster and allowing him to move and touch the player (which he can't do during a blue phase) and purple doing both at the same time. The trick in itself is that since the colours come form a lighthouse, the colors change depending on which side the lighthouse is showing. With the colours of the lighthouse changing when the player progresses the story.<br> The Ai itself of the monster is a pretty simple one, when he is allowed to move and do things (aka during red and purple) he will either move towards the player and when the player is touched, game over. Or if the player is hidden, he will roam arround without a purpose, until the player stops hidding again.",

The interesting part, I think, was mostly caused by production constraint, during the pre-production I wasn't able to make modification on the Player's blueprint (because github do not like Blueprints). I had to make an Actor Component where I put all of the code necessary to link the player to the beacon and vice versa. <br> The respawn system, when a player died, would check if it had a beacon in it's memory, if yes, it made the player respawn to the first beacon claimed that it has in memory, if it didn't have a beacon in memory, it would be game over for the player.",

The player that claims the beacon, will be able to use it as a respawn point if they died. Both player would also see day turning into night and the player that claimed the beacon would enter the hunt mode, they would see pings on the other player's location. However, if the player didn't complete the claiming process, and just let go of the button mid-claim, the color of the beacon would decrease until the player's color has dissapear from the beacon.<br> The players also has the ability to steal the other's beacon, if a beacon has already been claimed by an other player, the player can steal it (as implied a bit above).

I also worked on the settings of the game, took a while as well, this time because I didn't know how it worked, so I had to learn on the fly. I learnt how to make game saves, how key mapping worked, how to make audio parameters and a few other things. <br>Key mapping took a long time to figure out, and it works differently compared to the other settings that I made. The settings that i made are in widgets, one for each type of option, is it a slider ? a checkbox ? a dropbox ? a key ? The 3 first get their functions, titles and options in their respective widget and when a player make a modification, it will be sent to the settings UI where the code to handle the settings is. However, the key mapping widget only gets which key it will use as option and it will sends it's data to the Unreal Engine's native code when a player makes a modification.",

Overhaul more of a learning experience on how to work in a team rather than learning things for the project. I did enjoy working on this project a lot, even if competitive multiplayer games usually aren't my cup of tea.",
